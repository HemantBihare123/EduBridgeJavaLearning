Static methods in Java are methods that belong to the class rather than to a specific instance of the class. They are commonly used for utility or helper methods that do not require any instance data to operate. Here are some reasons why static methods are used:

1. Utility methods: Static methods can be used to provide utility or helper methods that do not depend on the state of an object. For example, the `Math` class in Java provides several static methods such as `Math.sqrt()` and `Math.random()` that perform mathematical calculations and do not require an instance of the `Math` class to be created.

2. Factory methods: Static methods can be used as factory methods to create new objects of a class. For example, the `getInstance()` method in the `Calendar` class returns an instance of the `Calendar` class based on the current time and date.

3. Counting or tracking data: Static methods can be used to count or track data across multiple instances of a class. For example, a `Student` class might have a static method `getTotalStudents()` that returns the total number of `Student` objects that have been created.

4. Performance optimization: Static methods can also be used for performance optimization. Because they do not operate on instance data, they can be called without creating an object of the class, which can be faster and more memory-efficient than creating an object for each method call.

5. Singleton pattern: Static methods can be used to implement the singleton design pattern, where a class is designed to have only one instance throughout the lifetime of the program.

Overall, static methods are a useful tool for providing utility methods, creating objects, tracking data, and optimizing performance in Java. However, it is important to use them judiciously and only when they are appropriate for the task at hand.
